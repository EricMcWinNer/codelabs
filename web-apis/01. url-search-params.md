So we talked about the first part of working with RESTful API.

## URL SearchParams

Before making a request you'll need to provide a HTTP METHOD and a URI. While URI Search Params manipulatation can be a quite time consuming and problematic if you decide to go through with implement them. But _let's do that anyway._

In this example we're gonna try to append some search params before making a request.

This is the full URL we expect
`https://some.api/distancematrix/json?userId=240&preferences=orange&preferences=blue&preferences=indigo`

```js
const getDistanceBetween = (userId) => {
  const params = {
    preferences: "orange", // <-- can only set one value
    userId,
  };

  return axios.get(`https://some.api/distancematrix/json?`, {
    params,
  });
};
```

The issue is evident. We can only set one color for preferences at a time. I know what you're think isn't a valid URI. But i was surprised as well when I discovered this. _It actually is_

Moving on, this would then request us to do some hacking around. But sadily there isn't any Data Type that allows directly setting a duplicate `value` to a `key`.

#### A naive attempt to solve this problem

Well we could just concatenate the strings.

```js
const getDistanceBetween = (userI d) => {
  let params = []

  for (let color of ["orange", "blue", "indigo"]) {
    params.push(`preferences=${color}`) // <-- can only set one value
  }

  params.push(`userId=${userId}`)
  params = params.join("&");

  return axios.get(`https://some.api/distancematrix/json?${params}`);
};
```

#### Solution

Introducing Web Standard `URLSearchParams` API. This API was created specifically to solve this problem and has been around for a long time (It's weird very few people I know use it).

```js
const getDistanceBetween = (userId) => {
  const params = new URLSearchParams({
    userId,
  });

  params.set("preferences", "orange");
  params.append("preferences", "blue"); // <-- `append` adds another value
  params.append("preferences", "indigo");

  return axios.get(`https://some.api/distancematrix/json?`, {
    params,
  });
};
```

This API has other API methods that simplify Search params manipulation. There's no need to invent the wheel
