There was a time I always wrote this in my projects

```js
    window.location.split("#")[1] // <--- retrieve hash
    window.location = window.location
        .toString()
        .replace(/#.+/, "heading-1");  // <--- set a hash
```

That was before I discovered this:
```js
    window.location.hash // <--- does exactly the same thing
    window.location.hash = "#james" // <-- set a hash
```

I'm sure most people will prefer the second method because the *intent* is clear. I guess this can bring up a new episode of clean code and all. 

In a case where you're trying to manipulate a URL string. I've shown how to manipulate the SearchParams in the `url-search-params.md`

Guess what, there's also a Web Standard API for URL manipulation.

Getting and setting a hash and other URL manipulations can be done using this API.
```js
const someUrl = "https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/third-party-libraries/#getting-started"

const urlInstance = new URL(someUrl)

// manipulating url hash
urlInstance.hash // #getting-started
urlInstance.hash = "#whats-next"
urlInstance.hash // #whats-next

// adjusting search params
urlInstance.search.set('userId', '205');

urlInstance.toString(); // <- should convert back to string
```
